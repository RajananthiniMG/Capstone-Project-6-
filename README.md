## Domain
Manufacturing

## Problem Statement
The copper industry deals with less complex data related to sales and pricing. However, this data may suffer from issues such as skewness and noisy data, affecting the accuracy of manual predictions. This project aims to address these challenges by developing machine learning models for predicting the selling price and status (Won or Lost) of industrial copper orders. The models will utilize advanced techniques such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization to improve prediction accuracy and efficiency.

## About the Data
The dataset contains various features related to copper transactions, including quantity tons, customer information, country, item type, application, thickness, width, material reference, product reference, delivery date, and selling price. The target variables are the selling price and status of the transactions.

## Approach
1. **Data Understanding:** Analyze the dataset to identify variable types and distributions.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, outliers, and skewness in the dataset. Encode categorical variables and perform feature engineering.
3. **EDA:** Visualize data distributions, outliers, and relationships between variables using Seaborn.
4. **Model Building and Evaluation:** Train and evaluate regression and classification models using Scikit-learn. Optimize model hyperparameters using cross-validation and grid search.
5. **Model GUI:** Create an interactive Streamlit page for predicting selling price and status based on user input.

## Learning Outcomes
- Proficiency in Python programming and data analysis libraries.
- Understanding of data preprocessing techniques and exploratory data analysis.
- Experience in building and optimizing machine learning models for regression and classification tasks.
- Knowledge of feature engineering techniques and model evaluation metrics.
- Ability to create interactive web applications using Streamlit.
- Understanding of challenges and best practices in the manufacturing domain.
